Computation of the clinical morphometric parameters requires the segmentation of endothelial cell images. Current techniques to image the endothelium in vivo deliver low quality images, which makes automatic segmentation a complicated task. Here, we present two convolutional neural networks (CNN) to segment CE images: a global fully convolutional approach based on U-net, and a local sliding-window network (SW-net). We propose to use probabilistic labels instead of binary, we evaluate a preprocessing method to enhance the contrast of images, and we introduce a postprocessing method based on Fourier analysis and watershed to convert the CNN output images into the final cell segmentation. Both methods are applied to 50 images acquired with an SP-1P Topcon specular microscope. Estimates are compared against a manual delineation made by a trained observer.ResultsU-net (AUC=0.9938) yields slightly sharper, clearer images than SW-net (AUC=0.9921). After postprocessing, U-net obtains a DICE=0.981 and a MHD=0.22 (modified Hausdorff distance), whereas SW-net yields a DICE=0.978 and a MHD=0.30. U-net generates a wrong cell segmentation in only 0.48% of the cells, versus 0.92% for the SW-net. U-net achieves statistically significant better precision and accuracy than both, Topcon and SW-net, for the estimates of three clinical parameters: cell density (ECD), polymegethism (CV), and pleomorphism (HEX). The mean relative error in U-net for the parameters is 0.4% in ECD, 2.8% in CV, and 1.3% in HEX. The computation time to segment an image and estimate the parameters is barely a few seconds.ConclusionsBoth methods presented here provide a statistically significant improvement over the state of the art. U-net has reached the smallest error rate. We suggest a segmentation refinement based on our previous work to further improve the performance.", "venue": "BMC biomedical engineering", "authors": ["Juan P.

The system uses the TextTiling algorithm to break a given document into segments that are centered around certain topics within the document. From these segments, keyphrases are generated using the KPMiner keyphrase extraction system. These keyphrases and segments are then used in generating queries indicative of the segment, and consequently the document. The queries are submitted to ChatNoir for finding plagiarism sources in the ClueWeb09 corpus from which the pan13 dataset is plagiarized. The target is to lessen the overall search effort while maximizing the performance by scoring unconsumed queries against the already downloaded candidate sources. Comparison to other PAN 2013 submissions for the same task, show the presented system to be one of the top performers.", "venue": "CLEF", "authors": ["Osama  Haggag", "Samhaa R.

The algorithm is probe-based, uses node priorities, and coordinates the actions of resolvers so that false deadlocks are not resolved.

Quality soft shadows are closely related to the visibility computation. An accurate visibility information improves the shadows realism. However, this remains a challenging problem since even small visibility approximations can lead to unacceptable errors in a picture. We propose a new approach to this problem, based on an exact visibility pre-computation, done in the Plucker space. It takes advantage of this first step to provide an exact from-point visibility query algorithm. We propose several results in a ray tracing application, where the direct illumination at any given point is provided with a fast computation, and with a high degree of quality.", "venue": "International 2005 Computer Graphics", "authors": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric  Mora", "Lilian  Aveneau"], "year": 2005, "n_citations": 13}

The average chunk length is about 1.38 tokens, F measure of chunking achieves 91.13%, labeling accuracy alone achieves 99.80% and the ratio of crossing brackets is 2.87%.

Previous reconstruction-based SR approaches focus more on the optimization models but have not adequately emphasized the mathematic-solving techniques for this typically ill-conditioned and under-determined large scale problem. Since step size plays an important role in the iterative SR process, and there is a tradeoff between less computation cost and higher accuracy, conventional SR methods either adopt a fixed step size to obtain a higher running speed, or use a computationally expensive line search algorithm to pursue an improvement in accuracy. Taking both cues into consideration, in this paper, we propose an adaptive line search strategy to realize the fast convergence of reconstruction-based SR. The approximate analytical expression of step size is introduced to prevent us from setting it empirically or running iterations to test a proper one. We further modify the proposed strategy to be more adaptive under different SR conditions. Using our strategy, one can accelerate the SR process and obtain the optimal solution with less iteration. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic data sets and real-world scenes. The results have demonstrated the effectiveness and outperformance of our proposed strategy compared with other line search strategies.", "venue": "IEEE Access", "authors": ["Yingqian  Wang", "Jungang  Yang", "Chao  Xiao", "Wei  An"], "year": 2018, "n_citations": 5}

This situation is common in acoustics, radio, medical signal and image processing, hyperspectral imaging, and other areas. We suggest a two-stage separation process: a priori selection of a possibly overcomplete signal dictionary (for instance, a wavelet frame or a learned dictionary) in which the sources are assumed to be sparsely representable, followed by unmixing the sources by exploiting the their sparse representability. We consider the general case of more sources than mixtures, but also derive a more efficient algorithm in the case of a nonovercomplete dictionary and an equal numbers of sources and mixtures. Experiments with artificial signals and musical sounds demonstrate significantly better separation than other known techniques.", "venue": "Neural Computation", "authors": ["Michael  Zibulevsky", "Barak A.
